<h1>Relative vs Absolute Links</h1>
<p>This link is relative. Do it this way, unless the link is external (to a different site).</p>
<a href="foo">foo</a>
<p>This link is absolute. If you do it this way, and the site is pysimple.com,
then when we point pysimplegui.com to the same site, these links will switch the
user to pysimple.com, which is wrong behavior.</p>
<a href="https://demo.timkay.com/foo">foo</a>
