        Demonstrates that a forEach will modify an array in place.
        I wrote this demo because Sequelize was giving me trouble this way.
        I finally realized that the object returned from a query treated
        properties specially, so updating columns in place didn't change
        the objet as intended.
        <pre></pre>
        <script>
            console.clear();
            const a = [
                {b: 10, c: 11},
            ];
            a.forEach(item => item.d = 12);
            $('pre').append(JSON.stringify(a));
        </script>
    </body>
